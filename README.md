Identification of Sleep Apnea using Deep Learning and
Machine Learning Techniques on ECG Data


Sleep Apnea(SA) patients have regular spells of
halting or decreasing airflow to the lungs for a period of time
exceeding ten seconds. Determining the right medications and
treatment methods requires identifying SA episodes accurately.
SA is detectable through a number of methods such as
polysomnography, ECG signals etc. A more efficient method, in
terms of time and effort, would be a machine learning or deep
learning based detection through an ECG signal. This work
follows two separate methods that can predict the risk of SA for
the user. The first method is a machine learning prediction based
on various features such as ESS, BQ, BMI etc., based on whose
values, the risk of the individual having SA can be predicted. The
second method is based on ECG image data. The PhysioNettECG
SA V1.0.0 dataset which contains 50 recordings from 50 people is
used in this work. The dataset is pre-processed and categorised
into four classes namely, A(severe apnea), B(modelate apnea),
C(normal apnea), X(non apnoeic). The VGG16-LSTM model
turned out to be the best model for classification with a F1-Score
of 90.83%.
